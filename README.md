# Hair_Guardian
Portable self-managed method to cool scalp for several hours using just one cooling cap.

Scalp cooling is achieved by extracting heat from the user’s scalp by circulating ice water through a cap worn by a user.  The water passing through the cap returns to a cooler near the user where it is again cooled prior to returning as ice water to the cap. The device is simple to build and control by the user.

The technology implemented in the Hair Guardian device was first published in the Journal of Medical Devices,  ( https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4027020 ),  by M. Zumbrunnen with title "Paradigm Shift Allows for Readily Available Therapeutic Hypothermia Treatment for the Head Region".

The technology was tested on cancer subjects that were prescribed for chemotherapy regimens that ‘always’ cause hair loss.  Oncologists recommended testing Doxorubicin, Docetaxel, and Paclitaxel based regimens.  This was reinforced by examination of the Dignitana De Novo (FDA, 2015) control group and by the Paxman 510(k) control group (FDA 510(k) K163484, 2017) where all results showed 100% hair loss for similar regimens.

The Hair Guardian was tested as intended under anticipated conditions of use and results demonstrated that Hair Guardian:
•	is effective in reducing chemotherapy-induced alopecia in women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy,
•	has no serious adverse events or non-serious adverse events beyond those already reported by its predicate, Paxman, or any other FDA-Cleared scalp cooling device, and
•	provides cooldown rates and stay cool scalp temperatures that are technically similar with its predicate, Paxman.
